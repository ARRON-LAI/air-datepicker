# Air Datepicker

Lightweight customizable cross-browser jQuery datepicker, built with es5 and css-flexbox. Works in all modern desktop and mobile browsers (tested on Android 4.4+ and iOS8+).

Forked from http://t1m0n.name/air-datepicker/, refined it to support AMD and fixed some bugs.

## Change log

### v2.4.2
* trigger onChangeMonth function while change view from 'year' to 'month'.
### v2.4.1
* refine datepicker to update view when mouse leave datepicker content body, so that 'in-range' classes won't be preserved when the mouse is no longer hover on datepicker after selecting one date when 'range' = true.
### v2.4.0
* refine build tasks for i18n so that jQuery won't be assumed as global variable; fix the bug that disabled navigation button (prev/next) is still clickable when change style to 'visibility = visible'.
* 
### v2.3.0
* support AMD for datepicker.en.js; fix the bug that when 'showOtherMonths' = false and other-month cell is still clickable.
* 
### v2.2.4
* support AMD for body.js, datepicker.js, timepicker.js and navigation.js
